## Tools and Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- HTML
- CSS
- Page Ranking Algorithms: BM25 , TF-IDF 

## Features

- **EN Search Engine**: DSA Seeker is developed using the EN stack (Express.js, Node.js), leveraging the power of these technologies to create a high-performance search engine.

- **Data Scraping**: We have scraped 3,500 coding problems from popular platforms like LeetCode, InterviewBit, and Codeforces using Selenium. This extensive collection of coding problems enriches the search engine's content and enhances the user's learning experience.

- **Robust Edge Case Handling**: DSA Seeker implements robust edge case handling techniques, including number-to-word conversion, lemmatization, spell-checking, and many others. These techniques ensure that the search engine performs accurately and provides relevant results even in challenging scenarios.

- **Advanced Search Algorithms**: DSA Seeker utilizes the powerful BM25 algorithm, TF-IDF indexes, RAM-based indexes, and efficient data structures to optimize search speed and accuracy. Custom scoring metrics are also implemented to enhance title matching and evaluate the reliability of sources.
